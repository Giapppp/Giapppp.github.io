In this post, I will try to describe my knowledge about SNARK. By the time I'm writing this post, [ZK Hack Discord](https://zkhack.dev/) is running ZK Whiteboard Study Group and they are discussing about SNARK, so maybe I'm lucky :D

## Detail

### What is a SNARK ?

In the class of non-interactive proofs, a particularly interesting concept for proving integrity of results for large computations is that of __SNARK__, i.e., __succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge__. By this term, we denote a proof system which is:

- __Succinct:__ the size of the proof is very small compared to the size of the statement or the witness, i.e., the size of the computation itself.

- __Non-interactive:__ it does not require rounds of interaction between the prover and the verifier.

- __Argument:__ we consider it secure only for provers that have bounded computational resources, which means that provers with enough computational power can convince the verifier of a wrong statement.

- __Knowledge-sound:__ it is not possible for the prover to construct a proof without knowing a certain so-called witness for the statement; formally, for any prover able to produce a valid proof, there is an extractor capable of extracting a witness (”the knowledge”) for the statement.

__Examples:__

- I know an $m$ such that $SHA256(m) = 0$

- I know $x$ such that $g^x = h \mod p$

__SNARK__ systems can be further equipped with a zero-knowledge property that enables the proof to be done without revealing anything about the intermediate steps (the witness). We will call these schemes __zk-SNARKs__.

zk-SNARK is really fit with blockchain, so we have lots of applications

### Mathematical Background

#### Arithmetic Circuits

Let $\mathbb{F}_p$ is a finite field with $p > 2$, then we can define __Arithmetic Circuits__ as: 

- A directed acyclic graph (DAG) where internal nodes are labeled $+, -$ or $*$, with input $x_i \in \mathbb{F}_p$ and $1$. 

- An $n$-variate polynomial with an evaluation recipe

- A map $C: F^n \to F$, with $|C|$ = number of gate

#### Argument Systems

A __preprocessing argument system__ is made up by three algorithms: Setting Algorithm, Prove Algorithm and Verify Algorithm (S, P, V):

- $S(C) \to$ public parameter $(S_p, S_v)$ for prover and verifier

- $P(S_p, x, w) \to$ proof $\pi$

- $V(S_v, x, \pi) \to$ accept or reject

An argument system requires:

- __Complete:__ $\forall x, w: C(x, w) = 0 \to Pr[V(s_v, x, P(S_p, x, w)) = accept] = 1$

- __Soundness:__ If $V$ accepts, then $P$ "knows" $x$ such that $C(x, w) = 0$, and if $P$ doesn't know $w$, then $Pr[V(s_v, x, P(S_p, x, w)) = accept] = negl$

- __Zero Knowledge:__(Optional) $(C, S_p, S_v, x, \pi)$ reveal nothing about $w$

#### SNARK: Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge

A __succinct preprocessing argument system__ is made up by three algorithms: Setting Algorithm, Prove Algorithm and Verify Algorithm (S, P, V):

- $S(C) \to$ public parameter $(S_p, S_v)$ for prover and verifier

- $P(S_p, x, w) \to$ __short__ proof $\pi$; $|\pi| = O(log(|C|), \lambda)$

- $V(S_v, x, \pi) \to$ accept or reject, __fast to verify__; $time(V) = O(|x|, log(|C|), \lambda)$
